# Future Changes
There are a couple of things I would like to update in the future on this application:

Calling up local weather upon document's first load: because the window information tied to this is in lon/lat rather than city name information, I would have to write a completely new way of performing city search on the page's first load. With the time crunch I decided that this would have to be completed at a later date.

Creating layout elements dynamically, rather than having them available to be appended to on first search: because the local weather does not appear on first load, the landing page looks sloppy until you've searched for your first city.
